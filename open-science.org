* COMMENT Structure thoughts

  - Need a strong opener

** Open Science

  - "Open science" section can cover
    - Popper?
      - Popper's thesis re falsifiability relates to how experiments
        are designed and what they cover
      - Reproducibility seems to be taken as a given?
    - Reproducibility
      - vs replicability, re-use etc.
    - Retraction Watch, Stapel, superconductors...
*** Outline
    - EU definition
    - Justification: Public money!
      - Should be able to learn and build on publically-funded research
      - Should be confident in quality of work
      - Research should be efficient -> lower overall cost to public
    - Standard: N Rs (where N is 2, 3, 4 or 5)
      - Rerun (same people, tinker with setup)
      - Repeat (same people, same setup)
      - Replicate (different people, same setup)
      - Reproduce (different people, different setup)
      - Reuse (similar setup, different experiment)

    - Stick to two for now
      - Reproducibility
        - Confidence in findings
      - Re-use
        - Improve productivity

    - FAIR principles
      - Research data has different problems

    - Expectations are rising
      - Journal policies
      - But people are struggling to adapt to these new policies...

    - Some general key principles
      - Reproducibility of experimental setups will always be tricky...
      - But no such excuse for analysis steps
      - Always keep raw data as well as processed forms
      - When processing data, consider
        a) Can I explain this?
        b) Can I automate it?
      - Avoid "locked-in" file formats
      - Use metadata and comments

** Sustainable software

*** Notes
   - Sustainable Software

     - Software is important and growing part of research
     - Even more so if you consider all analysis pipelines to be
       software. Are spreadsheets software?
     - Open Source -> FOSS
       - Open source enables /transparency/
         - Open source analysis makes reproducibility possible, but
           disincentivises if you can't then /build on it/
       - FOSS is really about the /license/
       - license enable /re-use/

*** Outline
    - Hettrick stats: researchers increasingly depend on software
    - Maybe we should consider data analysis steps and spreadsheets as
      "software"...
    - What is Open Source?
      - Code available - transparency
      - This enables replication
      - For re-use, need permission to build on code: FOSS license
      - For replication, is may help if the code is understandable and
        easy to work with...
    - Sustainable software is /maintainable/
      - Version control
      - Documentation
      - Automated testing
    - Community projects
      - Ambitious projects are better with friends

** Summary

   - Publicly-funded science wants to be open
   - Working openly is good for quality
   - Always keep raw data
   - Automation is documentation
   - Make stuff useable by other people
   - You'll thank yourself for that in a year's time

* Introduction

* Open Science

** Open Science
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Open Science is scholarly research that is collaborative,
   transparent and reproducible and whose outputs are publicly
   available.

   - [[https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/5b05b687-907e-11e8-8bc1-01aa75ed71a1][Some EU report]]
   #+END_QUOTE

** Open Science
   - In science we are usually building on previous work
   - It sucks when we can't access that work!
     - Papers
     - Data
     - Models
   - For our funders, this is /inefficient/

** Open Science
   - Openness increasingly required by research councils
   - Open Access policies
   - EPSRC requires a Data Access Statement in publications

** Some vocab
    - N 'R's (where N is 2, 3, 4 or 5)
      - Rerun (same people, tinker with setup)
      - Repeat (same people, same setup)
      - Replicate (different people, same setup)
      - Reproduce (different people, different setup)
      - Reuse (similar setup, different experiment)
    - /Some other presentations on this topic/
      - [[https://www.slideshare.net/carolegoble/what-is-reproducibility-gobleclean][Carole Goble slides]]
      - [[https://www.slideshare.net/gramian/rrr-replicability-reproducibility-reusability][Christian Himpe, MPI]]

** Less vocab
    - Reproduce
      - Improve /quality/ of research
    - Reuse
      - Improve /efficiency/ of research

** Reproducibility
   - Provide sufficient information for others to reproduce results
   - This should be the minimum standard for a scientific paper...
   - In practice it's not easy!
     - Survey results
     - Cancer studies
     - Retracted papers

** Re-use
   - Data sharing practices vary pretty wildly between fields

** Final Acronym
   - FAIR principles for Research Data

** Journal policies
   - In response to research council pressure, journals are requiring more
   - Policy for Science (HIGHLIGHT DOC)

** Journal policies
   In practice, change will take time!

   PAPER/QUOTES ON SOFTWARE ACCESS REQUESTS


** Good practice
   - Keep raw data
   - Automate everything
   - Avoid proprietary data formats
   - Keep metadata

* Sustainable Software

** Research software
   - 92% of academics use research software
   - 69% say that their research would not be practical without it
   - 56% develop their own software 
     - (worryingly, 21% of those have no training in software development)

    - Supporting research software community in the UK
    - "Better software, better research"
    - Training (partnership with Software Carpentry)
    - Advocacy/policy (Research Software Engineers)
    - Fellowship programme (this includes most of today's speakers!)

   Spreadsheets are software

   Spreadsheets are (terrible) software

   Spreadsheets are (terrible) software

   - Mix data and processing
   - Process is obscured as data cells and code cells look the same

   - ECONOMICS/AUSTERITY SPREADSHEET

** Open Source
   - Many programming languages (C, C++, Fortran, ...) are translated
     (compiled) to /machine code/
   - Software that is distributed as a machine code "binary" cannot be
     inspected
   - It is a "black box"
   - Open Source  means that the code can be examined
   - Some programs (e.g. Python, shell scripts) are not compiled before they are run
     - The source can always be examined

   #+REVEAL: split
   - Open source in a literal sense helps reproducibility:
     - exact process is exposed
     - implementation details can be identified/test/replicated
       - including bugs!

   - But licensing also matters

   - What is Open Source?
     - Code available - transparency
     - This enables replication
     - For re-use, need permission to build on code: FOSS license
     - For replication, is may help if the code is understandable and
       easy to work with...
