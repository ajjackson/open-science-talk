* COMMENT Structure thoughts

  - Need a strong opener

** Open Science

  - "Open science" section can cover
    - Popper?
      - Popper's thesis re falsifiability relates to how experiments
        are designed and what they cover
      - Reproducibility seems to be taken as a given?
    - Reproducibility
      - vs replicability, re-use etc.
    - Retraction Watch, Stapel, superconductors...
*** Outline
    - EU definition
    - Justification: Public money!
      - Should be able to learn and build on publically-funded research
      - Should be confident in quality of work
      - Research should be efficient -> lower overall cost to public
    - Standard: N Rs (where N is 2, 3, 4 or 5)
      - Rerun (same people, tinker with setup)
      - Repeat (same people, same setup)
      - Replicate (different people, same setup)
      - Reproduce (different people, different setup)
      - Reuse (similar setup, different experiment)

    - Stick to two for now
      - Reproducibility
        - Confidence in findings
      - Re-use
        - Improve productivity

    - FAIR principles
      - Research data has different problems

    - Expectations are rising
      - Journal policies
      - But people are struggling to adapt to these new policies...

    - Some general key principles
      - Reproducibility of experimental setups will always be tricky...
      - But no such excuse for analysis steps
      - Always keep raw data as well as processed forms
      - When processing data, consider
        a) Can I explain this?
        b) Can I automate it?
      - Avoid "locked-in" file formats
      - Use metadata and comments

** Sustainable software

*** Notes
   - Sustainable Software

     - Software is important and growing part of research
     - Even more so if you consider all analysis pipelines to be
       software. Are spreadsheets software?
     - Open Source -> FOSS
       - Open source enables /transparency/
         - Open source analysis makes reproducibility possible, but
           disincentivises if you can't then /build on it/
       - FOSS is really about the /license/
       - license enable /re-use/

*** Outline
    - Hettrick stats: researchers increasingly depend on software
    - Maybe we should consider data analysis steps and spreadsheets as
      "software"...
    - What is Open Source?
      - Code available - transparency
      - This enables replication
      - For re-use, need permission to build on code: FOSS license
      - For replication, is may help if the code is understandable and
        easy to work with...
    - Sustainable software is /maintainable/
      - Version control
      - Documentation
      - Automated testing
    - Community projects
      - Ambitious projects are better with friends

** Summary

   - Publicly-funded science wants to be open
   - Working openly is good for quality
   - Always keep raw data
   - Automation is documentation
   - Make stuff useable by other people
   - You'll thank yourself for that in a year's time

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Open Science is scholarly research that is collaborative,
   transparent and reproducible and whose outputs are publicly
   available.

   - [[https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/5b05b687-907e-11e8-8bc1-01aa75ed71a1][Some EU report]]
   #+END_QUOTE

   #+REVEAL: split

   - In science we are usually building on previous work
   - It sucks when we can't access that work!
     - Papers
     - Data
     - Models
   - For our funders, this is /inefficient/

   #+REVEAL: split

   - UKRI (body including EPSRC, AHRC, Innovate UK, STFC...) expects
     that articles funded by research councils will be freely
     available online
   - EPSRC requires a Data Access Statement in publications
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     ... publicly funded research data should generally be made as widely
     and freely available as possible in a timely and responsible
     manner
     #+END_QUOTE

** Some vocab
    - N 'R's (where N is 2, 3, 4 or 5)
      - Rerun (same people, tinker with setup)
      - Repeat (same people, same setup)
      - Replicate (different people, same setup)
      - Reproduce (different people, different setup)
      - Reuse (similar setup, different experiment)

** Less vocab
    - Reproducible outputs
      - Improve /quality/ of research
    - Reusable outputs
      - Improve /efficiency/ of research

** Reproducibility
   - Provide sufficient information for others to reproduce results
   - This should be the minimum standard for a scientific paper...
   - In practice it's not easy!

     - [[https://retractionwatch.com/][Retracted papers]]

** Re-use
   - Data sharing practices vary pretty wildly between fields
   - Some fields rely heavily on shared databases
   - Obtaining paper results by email has mixed results

** FAIR 
   Principles for "scientific data management" 
    https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618

    - Findable
      - Use persistent identifier
      - Use metadata
    - Available
      - Retrievable by an open standard protocal
    - Interoperable
      - Format data in a formal, accessible way
    - Reusable
      - "richly described" and using community standards
      - Usage license and detailed provenance   

** Journal policies
   - In response to research council pressure, journals are requiring more

   - /Science/ data/code availability policy (2011)
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     All data necessary to understand, assess, and extend the
     conclusions of the manuscript must be available to any reader of
     Science. All computer codes involved in the creation or analysis
     of data must also be available to any reader of Science. After
     publication, all reasonable requests for data and materials must
     be fulfilled. Any restrictions on the availability of data, codes,
     or materials, including fees and original data obtained from other
     sources (Materials Transfer Agreements), must be disclosed to the
     editors upon submission…

    In a recent study researchers requested data and code from a
    random sample of 204 /Science/ papers...

    When you approach a PI for the source codes and raw data, you
    better explain who you are, whom you work for, why you need the
    data and what you are going to do with it.
    #+END_QUOTE
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    I have to say that this is a very unusual request without any
    explanation! Please ask your supervisor to send me an email with a
    detailed, and I mean detailed, explanation.

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Thank you for your interest in our paper. For the [redacted]
   calculations I used my own code, and there is no public version of
   this code, which could be downloaded. Since this code is not very
   user-friendly and is under constant development I prefer not to
   share this code.
   #+END_QUOTE
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   R is a free software package available at www.r-project.org/ I used
   R for the [redacted] models. As you probably know, [redacted] and
   [redacted] are quite complicated. But I don’t have to tell you that
   given that you are a statistics student! I used Matlab for the
   geometry.

   The policy has been tweaked, but was that really the problem?

** Good practice
   - Keep raw data
   - Keep metadata
   - Avoid proprietary data formats
   - Automate everything
   - Host it somewhere
     - Code: Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab...
     - Data: Zenodo, Figshare, institutional repo, publisher...

* Sustainable Software

** Research software
   - 92% of academics use research software
   - 69% say that their research would not be practical without it
   - 56% develop their own software 
     - (worryingly, 21% of those have no training in software development)

   Spreadsheets are (terrible) software

   #+REVEAL: split

   Spreadsheets are (terrible) software

   - Mix data and processing
   - Data cells and code cells look the same
   - Errors can be hard to spot even in [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/04/16/is-the-best-evidence-for-austerity-based-on-an-excel-spreadsheet-error/][influential studies]]

** Open Source
   - Many programming languages (C, C++, Fortran, ...) are translated
     (compiled) to /machine code/
   - Software that is distributed as a machine code "binary" cannot
     easily be inspected
   - Reading machine code is serious hacker territory

   - Open Source  means that the code can be examined as written
   - Some programs (e.g. Python, shell scripts) are not compiled before they are run
     - The source can /always/ be examined
   - Open source in a literal sense helps reproducibility:
     - exact process is exposed
     - implementation details can be identified/test/replicated
       - including bugs!

   #+REVEAL: split

   - Open source is not enough! Licensing matters.
   - "Free Open Source Software (FOSS)" is
     - Free as in beer (gratis)
     - Free as in /Freedom/ (libre)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 If the users don't control the program, the program controls the
 users. With proprietary software, there is always some entity, the
 "owner" of the program, that controls the program and through it,
 exercises power over its users. A nonfree program is a yoke, an
 instrument of unjust power.

   Politics aside...

   - FOSS licenses give us the right to build on software and distribute it ourselves
   - This is /essential/ for community development of a codebase
   - In practice good changes can make it "upstream" or form a new code
   - Hybrids are possible: paid academic license, community development

** Sustainable software

   Sustainable software is /maintainable/

   - Coding style
   - Version control
   - Documentation
   - Testing
   - License
   - Enable contributions

** Documentation

   Documentation is the most important thing not on today's agenda

   Watch Daniele Procida's amazing talk about documentation
   - Pycon video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azf6yzuJt54
   - Blog version https://www.divio.com/en/blog/documentation/

** The secret method for a professional-looking project
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Steal stuff you like from other projects
   - Watch the issue tracker or mailing list of a project you care
     about and see how it develops
   - Use the same toolchain as projects you find easy to work with and
     copy their configurations

* Wrap-up
** Summary
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Publicly-funded science wants to be open
   - Working openly is good for quality
   - Always keep raw data
   - Use standard formats
   - Automate things
   - Make stuff useable by other people
   - You'll thank yourself for that in a year's time
